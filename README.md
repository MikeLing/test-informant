Test Informant
==============

A tool for inspecting the current state of running tests at Mozilla. It uses the [ActiveData][0]
service as its data source, and can generate HTML formatted reports containing information like
how many tests are running, skipped, added or removed over a given time period.

For more information, see the [project page][1].
